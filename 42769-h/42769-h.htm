<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p class="indent space-below">The work here presented to the Public is compiled from
the poetical writings of natives of the State of New-York.
The chief object in making the collection was to give 'a local
habitation and a name' to fugitive pieces, which, though deemed
worthy of being thus preserved, have hitherto been circulated
in the newspapers and periodicals solely. It was thought
well, however, by way of giving completeness to the work, to
embody with the rest specimens of those New-York poets
whose writings have been already collected in another shape.
The design of executing such a work only suggested itself
to the Publisher a fortnight before the last sheet was put to
press; and as he was desirous that <span class="smcap">The New-York Book</span>
should appear at the season when the annuals and other similar
publications are most in request, those who have aided him
in the compilation have perhaps vainly attempted to make up
in industry for the want of time. Under the most favourable
circumstances, however, it would be idle to attempt making
such a collection what it ought to be in a single volume. The
field of our Anthology is wider than any casual observer could
conceive; and even in thus rapidly exploring it, the sources
of so many new specimens have been indicated that it is
hoped the reception of this volume will be such as to warrant
the Publisher in soon following it up by another of the same
character.<br /><br />

<h3>THOUGHTS OF A STUDENT.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><b>BY JONATHAN LAWRENCE, JUN.</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><i>Ob</i>: 1833, <i>√¶t.</i> 25.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a sad, sweet thought have I,</span>
<span class="i2">Many a passing, sunny gleam,</span>
<span class="i0">Many a bright tear in mine eye,</span>
<span class="i2">Many a wild and wandering dream,</span>
<span class="i0">Stolen from hours I should have tied</span>
<span class="i0">To musty volumes by my side,</span>
<span class="i0">Given to hours that sweetly wooed</span>
<span class="i0">My heart from its study's solitude.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oft when the south wind's dancing free</span>
<span class="i2">Over the earth and in the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">And the flowers peep softly out to see</span>
<span class="i2">The frolic Spring as she wantons by,</span>
<span class="i0">When the breeze and beam like thieves come in,</span>
<span class="i0">To steal me away, I deem it sin</span>
<span class="i0">To slight their voice, and away I'm straying</span>
<span class="i0">Over the hills and vales a Maying.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then can I hear the earth rejoice,</span>
<span class="i2">Happier than man may ever be,</span>
<span class="i0">Every fountain hath then a voice</span>
<span class="i2">That sings of its glad festivity;</span>
<span class="i0">For it hath burst the chains, that bound</span>
<span class="i2">Its currents dead in the frozen ground,</span>
<span class="i0">And flashing away in the sun has gone,</span>
<span class="i0">Singing, and singing, and singing on.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Autumn hath sunset hours, and then</span>
<span class="i2">Many a musing mood I cherish,</span>
<span class="i0">Many a hue of fancy, when</span>
<span class="i2">The hues of earth are about to perish;</span>
<span class="i0">Clouds are there, and brighter, I ween,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath real sunset never seen,</span>
<span class="i0">Sad as the faces of friends that die,</span>
<span class="i0">And beautiful as their memory.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love hath its thoughts, we cannot keep,</span>
<span class="i2">Visions the mind may not control,</span>
<span class="i0">Waking as fancy does in sleep</span>
<span class="i2">The secret transports of the soul,</span>

<h3>THE DELAWARE WATER-GAP.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><b>BY MRS. E. F. ELLET</b></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our Western land can boast no lovelier spot.</span>
<span class="i0">The hills which in their ancient grandeur stand,</span>
<span class="i0">Piled to the frowning clouds, the bulwarks seem</span>
<span class="i0">Of this wild scene, resolved that none but Heaven</span>
<span class="i0">Shall look upon its beauty. Round their breast</span>
<span class="i0">A curtained fringe depends, of golden mist,</span>
<span class="i0">Touched by the slanting sunbeams; while below</span>
<span class="i0">The silent river, with majestic sweep,</span>
<span class="i0">Pursues his shadowed way,&mdash;his glassy face</span>
<span class="i0">Unbroken, save when stoops the lone wild swan</span>
<span class="i0">To float in pride, or dip his ruffled wing.</span>
<span class="i0">Talk ye of solitude?&mdash;It is not here.</span>
<span class="i0">Nor silence.&mdash;Low, deep murmurs are abroad.</span>
<span class="i0">Those towering hills hold converse with the sky</span>
<span class="i0">That smiles upon their summits;&mdash;and the wind</span>
<span class="i0">Which stirs their wooded sides, whispers of life,</span>
<span class="i0">And bears the burthen sweet from leaf to leaf,</span>
<span class="i0">Bidding the stately forest boughs look bright,</span>
<span class="i0">And nod to greet his coming!&mdash;And the brook,</span>
<span class="i0">That with its silvery gleam comes leaping down</span>
<span class="i0">From the hill-side, has, too, a tale to tell;</span>
<span class="i0">The wild bird's music mingles with its chime;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And gay young flowers, that blossom in its path,</span>
<span class="i0">Send forth their perfume as an added gift.</span>
<span class="i0">The river utters, too, a solemn voice,</span>
<span class="i0">And tells of deeds long past, in ages gone,</span>
<span class="i0">When not a sound was heard along his shores,</span>
<span class="i0">Save the wild tread of savage feet, or shriek</span>
<span class="i0">Of some expiring captive,&mdash;and no bark</span>
<span class="i0">E'er cleft his gloomy waters. Now, his waves</span>
<span class="i0">Are vocal often with the hunter's song;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Now visit, in their glad and onward course,</span>
<span class="i0">The abodes of happy men&mdash;gardens and fields&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And cultured plains&mdash;still bearing, as they pass,</span>
<span class="i0">Fertility renewed and fresh delights.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i2">The time has been,&mdash;so Indian legends say,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When here the mighty Delaware poured not</span>
<span class="i0">His ancient waters through&mdash;but turned aside</span>
<span class="i0">Through yonder dell, and washed those shaded vales.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, too, these riven cliffs were one smooth hill,</span>
<span class="i0">Which smiled in the warm sunbeams, and displayed</span>
<span class="i0">The wealth of summer on its graceful slope.</span>
<span class="i0">Thither the hunter chieftains oft repaired</span>
<span class="i0">To light their council fires,&mdash;while its dim height,</span>
<span class="i0">For ever veiled in mist, no mortal dared&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis said&mdash;to scale; save one white-haired old man,</span>
<span class="i0">Who there held commune with the Indian's God,</span>
<span class="i0">And thence brought down to men his high commands.</span>
<span class="i0">Years passed away&mdash;the gifted seer had lived</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond life's natural term, and bent no more</span>
<span class="i0">His weary limbs to seek the mountain's summit.</span>
<span class="i0">New tribes had filled the land, of fiercer mien,</span>
<span class="i0">Who strove against each other. Blood and death</span>
<span class="i0">Filled those green shades, where all before was peace,</span>
<span class="i0">And the stern warrior scalped his dying captive</span>
<span class="i0">E'en on the precincts of that holy spot</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Great Spirit had been. Some few, who mourned</span>
<span class="i0">The unnatural slaughter, urged the aged priest</span>
<span class="i0">Again to seek the consecrated height,</span>
<span class="i0">Succour from heaven, and mercy to implore.&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">They watched him from afar. He laboured slowly</span>
<span class="i0">High up the steep ascent&mdash;and vanished soon</span>
<span class="i0">Behind the folded clouds, which clustered dark</span>
<span class="i0">As the last hues of sunset passed away.</span>
<span class="i0">The night fell heavily&mdash;and soon were heard</span>
<span class="i0">Low tones of thunder from the mountain top,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering, and echoed from the distant hills</span>
<span class="i0">In deep and solemn peal,&mdash;while lurid flashes</span>
<span class="i0">Of lightning rent anon the gathering gloom.</span>
<span class="i0">Then wilder and more loud, a fearful crash</span>
<span class="i0">Burst on the startled ear;&mdash;the earth, convulsed,</span>
<span class="i0">Groaned from its solid centre&mdash;forests shook</span>
<span class="i0">For leagues around,&mdash;and by the sudden gleam</span>
<span class="i0">Which flung a fitful radiance on the spot,</span>
<span class="i0">A sight of dread was seen. The mount was rent</span>
<span class="i0">From top to base&mdash;and where so late had smiled</span>
<span class="i0">Green boughs and blossoms&mdash;yawned a frightful chasm,</span>
<span class="i0">Filled with unnatural darkness.&mdash;From afar</span>
<span class="i0">The distant roar of waters then was heard;</span>
<span class="i0">They came&mdash;with gathering sweep&mdash;o'erwhelming all</span>
<span class="i0">That checked their headlong course;&mdash;the rich maize field,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The low-roofed hut&mdash;its sleeping inmates&mdash;all&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Were swept in speedy, undistinguished ruin.</span>
<span class="i0">Morn looked upon the desolated scene</span>
<span class="i0">Of the Great Spirit's anger&mdash;and beheld</span>
<span class="i0">Strange waters passing through the cloven rocks:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And men looked on in silence and in fear,</span>
<span class="i0">And far removed their dwellings from the spot,</span>
<span class="i0">Where now no more the hunter chased his prey,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the war-whoop was heard.&mdash;Thus years went on:</span>
<span class="i0">Each trace of desolation vanished fast;</span>
<span class="i0">Those bare and blackened cliffs were overspread</span>
<span class="i0">With fresh green foliage, and the swelling earth</span>
<span class="i0">Yielded her stores of flowers to deck their sides.</span>
<span class="i0">The river passed majestically on</span>
<span class="i0">Through his new channel&mdash;verdure graced his banks;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The wild bird murmured sweetly as before</span>
<span class="i0">In its beloved woods,&mdash;and nought remained,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Save the wild tales which chieftains told,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To mark the change celestial vengeance wrought.</span>

<h3>THE SHIPWRECK OF CAMOENS.</h3>

<span class="i0">And fearfully the lightning flashed</span>
<span class="i2">Around the ship's tall mast,</span>
<span class="i0">While mournfully through the creaking shrouds</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pallid cheek the seamen shrank</span>
<span class="i2">Before the deepening gloom;</span>
<span class="i0">For they gazed on the black and boiling sea</span>
<span class="i2">As 'twere a yawning tomb;</span>
<span class="i0">But on the vessel's deck stood one</span>
<span class="i2">With proud and changeless brow;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor pain, nor terror was in the look</span>
<span class="i2">He turned to the gulf below.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And calmly to his arm he bound</span>
<span class="i2">His casket and his sword;</span>
<span class="i0">Unheeding, though with fiercer strength</span>
<span class="i2">The threatening tempest roared;</span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched his sinewy arms and cried:</span>
<span class="i2">"For me there yet is hope,</span>

<span class="i2">My freedom and my fame."</span>
<span class="i0">The dreaded moment came too soon,</span>
<span class="i2">The sea swept madly on,</span>
<span class="i0">Till the wall of waters closed around,</span>
<span class="i2">And the noble ship was gone.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then rose one wild, half-stifled cry;</span>
<span class="i2">The swimmer's bubbling breath</span>
<span class="i0">Was all unheard, while the raging tide</span>
<span class="i2">Wrought well the task of death;</span>
<span class="i0">But 'mid the billows still was seen</span>
<span class="i2">The stranger's struggling form;</span>
<span class="i0">And the meteor flash of his sword might seem</span>
<span class="i2">Like a beacon 'mid the storm.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Was then the love of pelf so strong</span>

<span class="i2">With such resistless power?</span>

<span class="i0">No! all earth's gold were dross to him,</span>
<span class="i2">Compared with what lay hid,</span>
<span class="i0">Through lonely years of changeless woe,</span>
<span class="i2">Beneath that casket's lid;</span>
<span class="i0">For there was all the mind's rich wealth,</span>

<span class="i0">That, in after years, he hoped might form</span>

<span class="i2">His nerveless limbs no more</span>
<span class="i0">Could bear him on through the waves that rose</span>
<span class="i2">Like barriers to the shore;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he held his long prized wealth,</span>
<span class="i2">He saw the wished-for land&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A moment more, and he was thrown</span>
<span class="i2">Upon the rocky strand.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! far better to have died</span>
<span class="i2">Where the mighty billows roll,</span>
<span class="i0">Than lived till coldness and neglect</span>
<span class="i2">Bowed down his haughty soul:</span>
<span class="i0">Such was his dreary lot, at once</span>
<span class="i2">His country's pride and shame;</span>
<span class="i0">For on Camoen's humble grave alone</span>
<span class="i2">Was placed his wreath of fame.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas on one morn, in spring-time weather,</span>
<span class="i2">A rosy, warm, inviting hour,</span>
<span class="i0">That Love and Faith went out together,</span>
<span class="i2">And took the path to Beauty's bower.</span>
<span class="i0">Love laughed and frolicked all the way,</span>
<span class="i2">While sober Faith, as on they rambled,</span>
<span class="i0">Allowed the thoughtless boy to play,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">So warm a welcome, Beauty smiled</span>
<span class="i2">Upon the guests whom chance had sent her,</span>
<span class="i0">That Love and Faith were both beguiled</span>
<span class="i2">The grotto of the nymph to enter;</span>
<span class="i0">And when the curtains of the skies</span>
<span class="i2">The drowsy hand of Night was closing,</span>
<span class="i0">Love nestled him in Beauty's eyes,</span>
<span class="i2">While Faith was on her heart reposing.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love thought he never saw a pair</span>
<span class="i2">So softly radiant in their beaming;</span>
<span class="i0">Faith deemed that he could meet no where</span>
<span class="i2">So sweet and safe a place to dream in;</span>
<span class="i0">And there, for life in bright content,</span>
<span class="i2">Enchained, they must have still been lying,</span>
<span class="i0">For Love his wings to Faith had lent,</span>
<span class="i2">And Faith he never dream'd of flying.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Beauty, though she liked the child,</span>
<span class="i2">With all his winning ways about him,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his mentor never smiled,</span>
<span class="i2">And thought that Love might do without him;</span>
<span class="i0">Poor Faith abused, soon sighing fled,</span>
<span class="i2">And now one knows not where to find him;</span>
<span class="i0">While mourning Love quick followed</span>
<span class="i2">Upon the wings he left behind him.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis said, that in his wandering</span>
<span class="i2">Love still around that spot will hover,</span>
<span class="i0">Like bird that on bewildered wing</span>
<span class="i2">Her parted mate pines to discover;</span>
<span class="i0">And true it is that Beauty's door</span>
<span class="i2">Is often by the idler haunted;</span>
<span class="i0">But, since Faith fled, Love owns no more</span>
<span class="i2">The spell that held his wings enchanted.</span>

<span class="i2">"As for Herod, he had spent vast sums about the cities, both without</span>
<span class="i0">and within his own kingdom: and as he had before heard that Hyrcanus,</span>
<span class="i0">who had been king before him, had opened David's sepulchre, and taken</span>
<span class="i0">out of it three thousand talents of silver, and that there was a</span>
<span class="i0">greater number left behind, and indeed enough to suffice all his wants,</span>
<span class="i0">he had a great while an intention to make the attempt; and at this time</span>
<span class="i0">he opened that sepulchre by night and went into it, and endeavoured</span>
<span class="i0">that it should not be at all known in the city, but he took only his</span>
<span class="i0">most faithful friends with him. As for any money, he found none, as</span>
<span class="i0">Hyrcanus had done, but that furniture of gold, and those precious goods</span>
<span class="i0">that were laid up there, all which he took away. However, he had a</span>
<span class="i0">great desire to make diligent search, and to go farther in, even as far</span>
<span class="i0">as the very bodies of David and Solomon; where two of his guards were</span>
<span class="i0">slain by a flame that burst out upon those that went in, as the report</span>
<span class="i0">was. So he was severely affrighted, and went out and built a</span>
<span class="i0">propitiatory monument of that fright he had been in, and this of white</span>
<span class="i0">stone, at the mouth of the sepulchre, and that at a great expense also.</span>

<span class="i0">Now, cease these tears, lay gentle Virgil by,</span>
<span class="i0">Let recent sorrows dim thy pausing eye;</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The day rose clear on Gibeon. Her high towers</span>

<span class="i0">Where armed heels trod carelessly the sweet</span>
<span class="i0">Wild spices, and the trees of gum were shook</span>
<span class="i0">By the rude armour on their branches hung.</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly in the camp without the walls</span>
<span class="i0">Rose a deep murmur, and the men of war</span>
<span class="i0">Gather'd around their kings, and "Joshua!</span>
<span class="i0">From Gilgal, Joshua!" was whisper'd low,</span>
<span class="i0">As with a secret fear, and then, at once,</span>
<span class="i0">With the abruptness of a dream, he stood</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the rock before them. Calmly then</span>
<span class="i0">Raised he his helm, and with his temples bare</span>
<span class="i0">And hands uplifted to the sky, he pray'd;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">"God of this people, hear! and let the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Stand upon Gibeon, still; and let the moon</span>
<span class="i0">Rest in the vale of Ajalon!" He ceased&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">He wandered far, and lingered long,</span>
<span class="i2">And drank so deep of Lethe's stream,</span>

<span class="i0">His thoughts were wanderers&mdash;and the things</span>

<span class="i2">Lighting the Grecian heroes' graves.</span>
<span class="i0">And he had gazed on trees and flowers</span>
<span class="i2">Beneath Italia's sunny skies,</span>
<span class="i0">And listened, in fair ladies' bowers,</span>
<span class="i2">To genius' words, and beauty's sighs.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His steps had echoed through the halls</span>
<span class="i2">Of grandeur, long left desolate;</span>
<span class="i0">And he had climbed the crumbling walls,</span>
<span class="i2">Or op'd perforce the hingeless gate;</span>
<span class="i0">And mused o'er many an ancient pile,</span>
<span class="i2">In ruin still magnificent,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose histories could the hours beguile</span>
<span class="i2">With dreams, before to fancy lent.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such recollections come to him,</span>

<span class="i0">Fierce howls the blast through sail and shroud,</span>

<span class="i0">In sunshine sleep the air and sea.</span>
<span class="i0">Pen may not paint each magic dye</span>
<span class="i0">On the soft wave and sunny sky,</span>
<span class="i0">When comes the charming silent eve,</span>
<span class="i0">And gentle billows idly heave.</span>
<span class="i0">The liquid floor bends smooth and bright,</span>
<span class="i0">Like molten silver to the light;</span>

<span class="i0">From heaven to earth, and sweetly playing</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ocean's giant breast,</span>
<span class="i0">Compose his savage soul to rest.</span>
<span class="i0">And thus, within the human mind,</span>
<span class="i0">When waves are hushed and still the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">When passion's storm has passed away,</span>

<span class="i0">Richer and rounder every year he grows,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor other ills his stagnant bosom knows</span>
<span class="i0">Than caitiff grub, or cursed Hessian fly,</span>
<span class="i0">Mildews, and smuts, a dry or humid sky;</span>
<span class="i0">Before he sells, the market's sudden fall,</span>
<span class="i0">Or sudden rise, when sold&mdash;still worse than all!</span>
<span class="i0">Calmly he lives&mdash;the tempest of the mind,</span>

<span class="i0">The purpose high that great ambition feels,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes perchance upon his vision steals,</span>
<span class="i0">But never in his sober waking thought</span>
<span class="i0">One stirring, active impulse ever wrought.</span>
<span class="i0">Calmly he lives&mdash;as free from good as blame,</span>
<span class="i0">His home, his dress, his equipage the same;</span>
<span class="i0">And when he dies, in sooth, 'tis soon forgot</span>
<span class="i0">What once he was, or what he once was not&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">An honest man, perhaps,&mdash;'tis somewhat odd</span>
<span class="i0">That such should be the noblest work of God!</span>
<span class="i2">So have I seen, in garden rich and gay,</span>
<span class="i0">A stately cabbage waxing fat each day;</span>
<span class="i0">Unlike the lively foliage of the trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Its stubborn leaves ne'er wave in summer breeze,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor flower, like those that prank the walks around,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon its clumsy stem is ever found;</span>
<span class="i0">It heeds not noontide heats, nor evening's balm,</span>
<span class="i0">And stands unmoved in one eternal calm.</span>
<span class="i0">At last, when all the garden's pride is lost</span>
<span class="i0">It ripens in drear autumn's killing frost,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a savoury sourkrout finds its end,</span>
<span class="i0">From which detested dish, me heaven defend!</span>

<span class="i0">One endless chaos spread before his eyes,</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now down the mountain's rugged western side,</span>
<span class="i0">Descending slow, our lonely travellers hied,</span>
<span class="i0">Deep in a narrow glen, within whose breast</span>
<span class="i0">The rolling fragments of the mountain rest;</span>
<span class="i0">Rocks tumbled on each other by rude chance,</span>
<span class="i0">Crown'd with grey fern, and mosses, met the glance,</span>
<span class="i0">Through which a brawling river braved its way,</span>
<span class="i0">Dashing among the rocks in foamy spray.</span>
<span class="i0">Here, 'mid the fragments of a broken world,</span>
<span class="i0">In wild and rough confusion, idly hurl'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Where ne'er was heard the woodman's echoing stroke,</span>
<span class="i0">Rose a huge forest of gigantic oak;</span>
<span class="i0">With heads that tower'd half up the mountain's side,</span>
<span class="i0">And arms extending round them far and wide,</span>
<span class="i0">They look'd coeval with old mother earth,</span>
<span class="i0">And seem'd to claim with her an equal birth.</span>
<span class="i0">There, by a lofty rock's moss-mantled base,</span>
<span class="i0">Our tired adventurers found a resting place;</span>
<span class="i0">Beneath its dark, o'erhanging, sullen brow,</span>
<span class="i0">The little bevy nestled snug below,</span>
<span class="i0">And with right sturdy appetite, and strong,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Devour'd the rustic meal they brought along.</span>
<span class="i2">The squirrel eyed them from his lofty tree,</span>
<span class="i0">And chirp'd as wont, with merry morning glee;</span>
<span class="i0">The woodcock crow'd as if alone he were,</span>
<span class="i0">Or heeded not the strange intruders there,</span>
<span class="i0">Sure sign they little knew of man's proud race</span>
<span class="i0">In that sequester'd mountain 'biding place;</span>
<span class="i0">For wheresoe'er his wandering footsteps tend,</span>
<span class="i0">Man never makes the rural train his friend;</span>
<span class="i0">Acquaintance that brings other beings near,</span>
<span class="i0">Produces nothing but distrust or fear:</span>
<span class="i0">Beasts flee from man the more his heart they know,</span>
<span class="i0">And fears, at last, to fix'd aversion grow,</span>
<span class="i0">As thus in blithe serenity they sat,</span>
<span class="i0">Beguiling resting time with lively chat,</span>
<span class="i0">A distant, half heard murmur caught the ear,</span>
<span class="i0">Each moment waxing louder and more near,</span>
<span class="i0">A dark obscurity spread all around,</span>
<span class="i0">And more than twilight seem'd to veil the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">While not a leaf e'en of the aspen stirr'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And not a sound but that low moan was heard.</span>
<span class="i0">There is a moment when the boldest heart</span>
<span class="i0">That would not stoop an inch to 'scape death's dart,</span>
<span class="i0">That never shrunk from certain danger here,</span>
<span class="i0">Will quail and shiver with an aguish fear;</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis when some unknown mischief hovers nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And heaven itself seems threatening from on high.</span>
<span class="i2">Brave was our Basil, as became a man,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet still his blood a little cooler ran,</span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt fear and wonder, at that murmur drear,</span>
<span class="i0">That every moment wax'd more loud and near.</span>
<span class="i0">The riddle soon was read&mdash;at last it came,</span>
<span class="i0">And nature trembled to her inmost frame;</span>
<span class="i0">The forest roar'd, the everlasting oak,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In writhing agonies the storm bespoke,</span>
<span class="i0">The live leaves scatter'd wildly everywhere,</span>
<span class="i0">Whirl'd round in maddening circles in the air;</span>
<span class="i0">The stoutest limbs were scatter'd all around,</span>
<span class="i0">The stoutest trees a stouter master found,</span>
<span class="i0">Crackling, and crashing, down they thundering go,</span>
<span class="i0">And seem to crush the shrinking rocks below:</span>
<span class="i0">Then the thick rain in gathering torrents pour'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Higher the river rose, and louder roar'd,</span>
<span class="i0">And on its dark, quick eddying surface bore</span>
<span class="i0">The gather'd spoils of earth along its shore,</span>
<span class="i0">While trees that not an hour before had stood</span>
<span class="i0">The lofty monarchs of the stately wood,</span>
<span class="i0">Now whirling round and round with furious force,</span>
<span class="i0">Dash 'gainst the rocks that breast the torrent's force,</span>
<span class="i0">And shiver like a reed by urchin broke</span>
<span class="i0">Through idle mischief, or with heedless stroke;</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred cataracts, unknown before,</span>
<span class="i0">Rush down the mountain's side with fearful roar,</span>
<span class="i0">And as with foaming fury down they go,</span>
<span class="i0">Loose the firm rocks and thunder them below;</span>
<span class="i0">Blue lightnings from the dark cloud's bosom sprung,</span>
<span class="i0">Like serpents, menacing with forked tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">While many a sturdy oak that stiffly braved</span>
<span class="i0">The threatening hurricane that round it raved,</span>
<span class="i0">Shiver'd beneath its bright, resistless flash,</span>
<span class="i0">Came tumbling down amain with fearful crash.</span>
<span class="i0">Air, earth, and skies, seem'd now to try their power,</span>
<span class="i0">And struggle for the mastery of the hour;</span>
<span class="i0">Higher the waters rose, and blacker still,</span>
<span class="i0">And threaten'd soon the narrow vale to fill.</span>

<h3>THE MITCHELLA.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><b>BY S. L. MITCHELL.</b></p>

<p class="blockquot">[The Mitchella is a very delicate flower,
a native of our woods, and although originally named from another botanist
called Mitchell, was always a great favourite of Dr. S. L. Mitchell.
The "double nature" alluded to in the poem refers to the fact of
the flowers uniformly growing in pairs.]</p>

<span class="i0">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house</span>
<span class="i0">Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</span>
<span class="i0">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</span>
<span class="i0">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;</span>
<span class="i0">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</span>
<span class="i0">While visions of sugar-plums danced through their heads;</span>
<span class="i0">And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</span>
<span class="i0">I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter:</span>
<span class="i0">Away to the window I flew like a flash,</span>
<span class="i0">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</span>
<span class="i0">The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,</span>
<span class="i0">Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.</span>
<span class="i0">When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,</span>
<span class="i0">But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,</span>
<span class="i0">With a little old driver, so lively and quick,</span>
<span class="i0">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.</span>
<span class="i0">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</span>
<span class="i0">And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;</span>
<span class="i0">"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer! now, Vixen!</span>
<span class="i0">On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Donder and Blixen&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!</span>
<span class="i0">Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"</span>
<span class="i0">As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,</span>
<span class="i0">When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,</span>
<span class="i0">With the sleigh full of toys&mdash;and St. Nicholas too.</span>
<span class="i0">And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof</span>
<span class="i0">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</span>
<span class="i0">As I drew in my head, and was turning around,</span>
<span class="i0">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</span>
<span class="i0">He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,</span>
<span class="i0">And his clothes were all tarnish'd with ashes and soot;</span>
<span class="i0">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</span>
<span class="i0">And he look'd like a pedlar just opening his pack.</span>
<span class="i0">His eyes&mdash;how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!</span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;</span>
<span class="i0">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</span>
<span class="i0">And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.</span>
<span class="i0">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.</span>
<span class="i0">He had a broad face and a little round belly</span>
<span class="i0">That shook, when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of jelly.</span>
<span class="i0">He was chubby and plump; a right jolly old elf;</span>
<span class="i0">And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.</span>
<span class="i0">A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,</span>
<span class="i0">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</span>
<span class="i0">He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</span>
<span class="i0">And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jirk,</span>
<span class="i0">And laying his finger aside of his nose,</span>
<span class="i0">And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.</span>
<span class="i0">He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</span>
<span class="i0">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;</span>
<span class="i0">But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight,</span>
<span class="i0">"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</span>

<h3>TO THE DYING YEAR.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: center;"><b>BY J. G. BROOKS.</b></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">Emblem of transitory man,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose wearisome and wild career</span>
<span class="i2">Like thine is bounded to a span;</span>
<span class="i0">It seems but as a little day</span>
<span class="i2">Since nature smiled upon thy birth,</span>
<span class="i0">And Spring came forth in fair array,</span>
<span class="i2">To dance upon the joyous earth.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sad alteration! now how lone,</span>
<span class="i2">How verdureless is nature's breast,</span>
<span class="i0">Where ruin makes his empire known,</span>
<span class="i2">In Autumn's yellow vesture drest;</span>
<span class="i0">The sprightly bird, whose carol sweet</span>
<span class="i2">Broke on the breath of early day,</span>
<span class="i0">The summer flowers she loved to greet;</span>
<span class="i2">The bird, the flowers, Oh! where are they?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">Yet lovely in thy lifelessness</span>
<span class="i0">As beauty stretched upon the bier,</span>
<span class="i2">In death's clay cold, and dark caress;</span>
<span class="i0">There's loveliness in thy decay,</span>
<span class="i2">Which breathes, which lingers on thee still,</span>
<span class="i0">Like memory's mild and cheering ray</span>
<span class="i2">Beaming upon the night of ill.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, yet, the radiance is not gone,</span>
<span class="i2">Which shed a richness o'er the scene,</span>
<span class="i0">Which smiled upon the golden dawn,</span>
<span class="i2">When skies were brilliant and serene;</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! still a melancholy smile</span>
<span class="i2">Gleams upon Nature's aspect fair,</span>
<span class="i0">To charm the eye a little while,</span>
<span class="i2">Ere ruin spreads his mantle there!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">Since time entwined thy vernal wreath,</span>
<span class="i0">How often love hath shed the tear,</span>
<span class="i2">And knelt beside the bed of death;</span>
<span class="i0">How many hearts that lightly sprung</span>
<span class="i2">When joy was blooming but to die,</span>
<span class="i0">Their finest chords by death unstrung,</span>
<span class="i2">Have yielded life's expiring sigh,</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And pillowed low beneath the clay,</span>
<span class="i2">Have ceased to melt, to breathe, to burn;</span>
<span class="i0">The proud, the gentle, and the gay,</span>
<span class="i2">Gathered unto the mouldering urn;</span>
<span class="i0">While freshly flowed the frequent tear</span>
<span class="i2">For love bereft, affection fled;</span>
<span class="i0">For all that were our blessings here,</span>
<span class="i2">The loved, the lost, the sainted dead!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">The musing spirit finds in thee</span>
<span class="i0">Lessons, impressive and serene,</span>
<span class="i2">Of deep and stern morality;</span>
<span class="i0">Thou teachest how the germ of youth,</span>
<span class="i2">Which blooms in being's dawning day,</span>
<span class="i0">Planted by nature, reared by truth,</span>
<span class="i2">Withers like thee in dark decay.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Promise of youth! fair as the form</span>
<span class="i2">Of Heaven's benign and golden bow,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy smiling arch begirds the storm,</span>
<span class="i2">And sheds a light on every wo;</span>
<span class="i0">Hope wakes for thee, and to her tongue,</span>
<span class="i2">A tone of melody is given,</span>
<span class="i0">As if her magic voice were strung</span>
<span class="i2">With the empyreal fire of Heaven.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And love which never can expire,</span>
<span class="i2">Whose origin is from on high,</span>
<span class="i0">Throws o'er thy morn a ray of fire,</span>
<span class="i2">From the pure fountains of the sky;</span>
<span class="i0">That ray which glows and brightens still</span>
<span class="i2">Unchanged, eternal and divine;</span>
<span class="i0">Where seraphs own its holy thrill,</span>
<span class="i2">And bow before its gleaming shrine.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">Prophetic of our final fall;</span>
<span class="i0">Thy buds are gone, thy leaves are sear,</span>
<span class="i2">Thy beauties shrouded in the pall;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the garniture that shed,</span>
<span class="i2">A brilliancy upon thy prime,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath like a morning vision fled</span>
<span class="i2">Unto the expanded grave of time.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Time! Time! in thy triumphal flight,</span>
<span class="i2">How all life's phantoms fleet away;</span>
<span class="i0">The smile of hope, and young delight,</span>
<span class="i2">Fame's meteor beam, and Fancy's ray:</span>
<span class="i0">They fade; and on the heaving tide,</span>
<span class="i2">Rolling its stormy waves afar,</span>
<span class="i0">Are borne the wreck of human pride,</span>
<span class="i2">The broken wreck of Fortune's war.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There in disorder, dark and wild,</span>
<span class="i2">Are seen the fabrics once so high;</span>
<span class="i0">Which mortal vanity had piled</span>
<span class="i2">As emblems of eternity!</span>
<span class="i0">And deemed the stately piles, whose forms</span>
<span class="i2">Frowned in their majesty sublime,</span>
<span class="i0">Would stand unshaken by the storms</span>
<span class="i2">That gathered round the brow of Time.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou desolate and dying year!</span>
<span class="i2">Earth's brightest pleasures fade like thine;</span>
<span class="i0">Like evening shadows disappear,</span>
<span class="i2">And leave the spirit to repine.</span>
<span class="i0">The stream of life that used to pour</span>
<span class="i2">Its fresh and sparkling waters on,</span>
<span class="i0">While Fate stood watching on the shore,</span>
<span class="i2">And numbered all the moments gone:&mdash;</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where hath the morning splendour flown,</span>
<span class="i2">Which danced upon that crystal stream?</span>
<span class="i0">Where are the joys to childhood known,</span>
<span class="i2">When life was an enchanted dream?</span>
<span class="i0">Enveloped in the starless night,</span>
<span class="i2">Which destiny hath overspread;</span>
<span class="i0">Enroll'd upon that trackless flight</span>
<span class="i2">Where the death wing of time hath sped!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! thus hath life its even-tide</span>
<span class="i2">Of sorrow, loneliness, and grief;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus divested of its pride,</span>
<span class="i2">It withers like the yellow leaf:</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! such is life's autumnal bower,</span>
<span class="i2">When plundered of its summer bloom;</span>
<span class="i0">And such is life's autumnal hour,</span>
<span class="i2">Which heralds man unto the tomb!</span>

It may perhaps, to some, appear incongruous thus to mingle
Heathen musicians among the Hebrews; but it is believed the incongruity
will disappear on a moment's reflection upon the history and character
of Herod the Great. His expeditions to Rome, Greece, and Syria, &amp;c.,
were frequent, and he was not scrupulous in the introduction of games,
sports, and gorgeous customs of the oriental nations, to heighten the
effect of his own pageants. He built and rebuilt divers Heathen temples,
and among them the Temple of Apollo, in Greece. Some historians deny
that he was a Jew; but say that he was originally the guardian of the
Temple of Apollo at Askalon, who, having been taken prisoner among the
Idumeans, afterwards turned Jew.

The above lines were translated by Dr. Mitchell, in October 1796,
from the Italian of Dr. Gian Baptista Scandella, an accomplished gentleman,
who afterwards, in September 1798, fell a victim to the yellow fever in
the city of New York, just as he had finished his American tour, and was
on the eve of embarking for Europe.
